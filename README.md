# Making maps with Haskell
This project is an attempt to recreate the Polygonal Map Generation for Games from Amit Pate's tutorial at (http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation)

I'm using his techniques as a guide and implementing in Haskell with the gloss graphics library.

## Gloss
Gloss is a graphics drawing library that uses OpenGL.
